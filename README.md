# FriendsOnly
This project was created to sharpen my full stack skills as a part of the Odin Project.

## Functionality
- A user visiting the website should be able to view all created posts, however, they must log in to see who is the author and title.
- A logged in user will be able to view all posts unrestricted.
- A logged in user who has upgraded their membership shall be able to create a post and submit it to the forum (code to upgrade is learnFullStack).
- The app is fully responsive and hosted via vercel.
